aiyprojects is an easy-to-use API for the AIY Vision Kit and
AIY Voice Kit.
You can use it for face detection and object recognition, or use it to create
voice commands with simple while loops - have a look at the
[demos](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian/tree/aiyprojects/src/examples).

Documentation is at the [AIY Projects site](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com).

If you have a problem or are looking for developer docs, look at the
GitHub repository's
[README.md](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian#support).
